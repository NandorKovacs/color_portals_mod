normal_dist_cost = (x/160)^2
base_cost = 5;


Overworld: 	dim_cost = 0
		dist_cost = normal_dist_cost(x)

Nether: dim_cost = 20
	dist_cost = normal_dist_cost(x * 8)

End: 	dim_cost = 50 + dist_cost(1024)
	
	dist_cost = normal_dist_cost(x - 1024)


Overall formula for portal a and portal b:

base_cost + dim_cost_a + dim_cost_b + dist_cost
